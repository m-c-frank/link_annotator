# link annotator

it displays two nodes from a graph

lets you write down a description of how the nodes relate in your head

lets you numerically set the similarity of the nodes

## coming soon

different modes:

- simple: lets you manually annotate the nodes
- supervisor: lets a language model propose how the nodes relate and you edit it
- trainer: similar to supervisor but intended to generate synthetic training data for your own language model
